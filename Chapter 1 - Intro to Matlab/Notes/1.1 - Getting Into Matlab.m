% When the Matlab software is started, a window opens in which the main
% part is the Command Window. The " >> " is called the "prompt".

% The Command Window can be used interactively and Matlab will respond
% immediately.

% Useful starting functions: "demo", "help", "lookfor", "doc".
% Note: "help help" explains how help works.
% To exit Matlab, type either "quit" or "exit" at the prompt.
% To run a line of code, use "command + enter".
